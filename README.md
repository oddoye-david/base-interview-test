# Interview Test

Build a page using the [SWAPI API](https://swapi.co/documentation) to show the list of Star Wars films.

First page should show the movie titles as links, clicking on a link should lead to another page that shows the `title` `director`, `producer` and `opening_crawl`.

Use any framework of your choice and submit a Pull Request when you're done.

Good Luck.
